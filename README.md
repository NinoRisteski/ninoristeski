##### I am searching for a role as an ML Engineer. Please reach out!

## Latest Projects

- **[tinypilot](https://github.com/ninoristeski/tinypilot)**: An AI agent that helps you learn the `tinygrad` codebase and updates you on the latest bounties.
- **[HubermanAnswers](https://github.com/ninoristeski/HubermanAnswers)**: Ask questions, get answers straight from Dr. Andrew Hubermanâ€™s podcast episodes! This Python-based tool uses NLP to deliver precise, context-aware responses from audio transcripts.

- **[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/ninoristeski/transformer-from-scratch)**: A clean, from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper, built with PyTorch. 

## Currently:
- Learning the nuts and bolts (GPU/Compiler part) of `tinygrad`.
- Building end-to-end ML projects that solve personal and practical challenges.
