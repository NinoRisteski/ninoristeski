## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I have a [blog](https://ninoristeski.github.io/) for bio.
##### I am searching for a role as an ML Engineer. Please reach out!

## Latest Projects

- **[tinypilot](https://github.com/[your-username]/tinypilot)**  
  An AI agent that helps you learn the `tinygrad` framework and keeps you updated on the latest bounties.
- **[HubermanAnswers](https://github.com/[your-username]/HubermanAnswers)**  
  Ask questions, get answers straight from Dr. Andrew Hubermanâ€™s podcast episodes! This Python-based tool uses NLP to deliver precise, context-aware responses from audio transcripts.  

- **[ShallowFlow](https://github.com/[your-username]/ShallowFlow)**
  A lightweight, distributed LLM training framework optimized for cost-effective training on local GPUs and AWS T4 instances.(In progress)

- **[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/[your-username]/transformer-from-scratch)**  
  A clean, from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper, built with PyTorch. 

## Currently:
- Exploring minimalist ML frameworks like `tinygrad` for efficient model training.
- Building end-to-end ML projects that solve personal and practical challenges.
- Contributing to open-source (Unsloth, Browser-Use...) to make machine learning more accessible.
