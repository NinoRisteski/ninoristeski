## Hi there 👋

## Personal [blog](https://ninoristeski.github.io/).📓
##### I am searching for a role as an ML Engineer. Please reach out!

## Latest Projects

- **👨‍🚀[tinypilot](https://github.com/ninoristeski/tinypilot)**: An AI agent that helps you learn the `tinygrad` codebase and updates you on the latest bounties.
- **👨‍🔬[HubermanAnswers](https://github.com/ninoristeski/HubermanAnswers)**: Ask questions, get answers straight from Dr. Andrew Huberman’s podcast episodes! This Python-based tool uses NLP to deliver precise, context-aware responses from audio transcripts.  

- **👨‍💻[ShallowFlow](https://github.com/ninoristeski/ShallowFlow)**: A lightweight, distributed LLM training framework focused on cost-effective training on local GPU and AWS.(In progress)

- **🤖[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/ninoristeski/transformer-from-scratch)**: A clean, from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper, built with PyTorch.

- **🦾GPTmashina**: GPT2 built from scratch for learning purposes. Optimized with training speedups: Flash Attention, mixed precision (bfloat16), model compilation with torch.compile, and cloud GPU deployment on V100.
 

## Currently:
- Learning the nuts and bolts (GPU/Compiler part) of `tinygrad`.
- Building end-to-end ML projects that solve personal and practical challenges.
- Contributing to open-source (Unsloth, Browser-Use...).
