## Hi there 👋

### I have a [blog](https://ninoristeski.github.io/) for bio.

## Featured Projects

- **[tinypilot](https://github.com/[your-username]/tinypilot)**  
  An AI-powered agent that simplifies learning the `tinygrad` framework and keeps you updated on the latest bounties. Built with Python, it’s your go-to companion for mastering minimalist ML libraries.  

- **[HubermanAnswers](https://github.com/[your-username]/HubermanAnswers)**  
  Ask questions, get answers straight from Dr. Andrew Huberman’s podcast episodes! This Python-based tool uses NLP to deliver precise, context-aware responses from audio transcripts.  

- **[ShallowFlow](https://github.com/[your-username]/ShallowFlow)**  
  A lightweight, distributed LLM training framework optimized for cost-effective training on local GPUs and AWS T4 instances. Designed for simplicity and scalability.  

- **[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/[your-username]/transformer-from-scratch)**  
  A clean, from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper, built with PyTorch. Perfect for understanding the nuts and bolts of modern NLP models.  

## Skills & Tools
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas
- **ML/AI**: Deep Learning, Transformers, NLP, Distributed Training
- **Platforms**: AWS, Docker, Git
- **Interests**: MLOps, GPU optimization, open-source AI tools

## What I'm Working On
- Exploring minimalist ML frameworks like `tinygrad` for efficient model training.
- Building end-to-end ML projects that solve personal and practical challenges.
- Contributing to open-source (Unsloth, Browser-Use...) to make machine learning more accessible.
