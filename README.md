## Latest Projects

- **[tinypilot](https://github.com/ninoristeski/tinypilot)**: AI agent that helps you learn the `tinygrad` codebase and updates you on the latest bounties.
- **[HubermanAnswers](https://github.com/ninoristeski/HubermanAnswers)**: Ask questions, get answers straight from Dr. Andrew Hubermanâ€™s podcasts - an AI agent that uses NLP to deliver context-aware responses from podcast transcripts.  

- **[ShallowFlow](https://github.com/ninoristeski/ShallowFlow)**: Lightweight LLM training framework focused on cost-effective training on local GPU and AWS.(In progress)

- **[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/ninoristeski/transformer-from-scratch)**: From-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper, built with PyTorch.

- **ðŸ¦¾GPTmashina**: GPT2 built from scratch for learning purposes. Optimized with training speedups: Flash Attention, mixed precision (bfloat16), model compilation with torch.compile, and cloud GPU deployment on V100.
 

## Currently:
- Learning and contributing to `tinygrad`.
- Building end-to-end ML projects that solve personal and practical challenges.
- Contributing to open-source (Tinygrad, Unsloth, Browser-Use...).
